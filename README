~~~~~~~~
small utilities for automatic processing of 2.11-BSD patches into git
commits.

status
~~~~~~
works from pl431 to 459. 

quick guide
~~~~~~~~~~~
from zero to repo:

$ make

run one patch only:

$ make PATCH=460 singleshot

longer explanation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
make all does the following:

- rsync 2.11-BSD from TUHS
- extract the root dump and file[678].tar.gz into a directory
- remove binaries
- create a git commit from this, using VERSION file as the message and
  its timestamp as the commit date
- unpack patches into a separate directory
- start applying patches one by one, using the patch file date as the commit
  date
